    "# Visualizing Simulated Satellites Rotation Around the Earth\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the fascinating dynamics of satellite motion around the Earth. By simulating the rotation of satellites, we can gain a deeper understanding of orbital mechanics and the forces at play. This visualization will help us observe the trajectories, velocities, and positions of satellites as they orbit our planet. Let's dive into the simulation and visualize the mesmerizing dance of satellites around the Earth."
